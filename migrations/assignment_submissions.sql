-- GROUP BY and HAVING example

-- GROUP BY allows us to combine the results based on a column so an aggregate can be applied to each group.
-- HAVING allows us to filter our results based on the result of an aggregate function.

-- SELECT students.name as student, count(assignment_submissions.*) as total_submissions
-- FROM assignment_submissions
-- JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
-- WHERE students.end_date IS NULL
-- GROUP BY students.name
-- HAVING count(assignment_submissions.*) < 100;
